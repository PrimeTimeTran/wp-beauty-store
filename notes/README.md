Hello Huyen,
I'm sorry I probably should have written this in the job. Would you be ok with completing a short exercise to apply for the job?

I'd like you to write a top 5 article on any of the topics mentioned in the JD. For example top 5 ways to stay thin and eat what you want. I'm hoping you can be creative and work great when given freedom to come up with your own ideas. 

- [ ] The article should be on any of the topics mentioned in the JD(health, fitness, beauty, diet, nutrition, exercise, etc.)
- [ ] The article should be in both English & Vietnamese.
- [ ] The article should be formatted using Markdown with headers, bullet points, punctuation, etc.
- [ ] It should include images/gifs/videos where appropriate.
- [ ] Lastly I hope you could also include citations on any facts you make.

For each article could you share to something like HackMd?

Also please upload images/gifs to

and

respectively so you can include whatever assets you feel are appropriate.

Lastly I'd like to say I hope the writing still is familiar, friendly, not too formal. I want the reader laugh with you if you make a great joke and cry if you tell a sad story. That's the idea tone.

Im sorry I know that was a lot. Thanks for reading and hoping to hear back from you.
